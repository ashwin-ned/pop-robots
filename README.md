## Description
This artwork reimagines machines through a unique process. AI-generated art is merged and then transformed with classical computer vision techniques typically used for image processing to create a striking pop-art aesthetic. Showcasing the interaction between established computer vision algorithms and novel generative AI tools, this piece explores the interplay between human and machine creativity and the future of art.
